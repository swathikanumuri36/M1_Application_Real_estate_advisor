# Introduction


- Real estate will provide facility to the user to search Residential and Commercial property and view property. It will also provide facility to view the property by admin and user.User will able to upload the property information to the site and able to manage it.<br>
- Real estate advisor helps people to connect ecah other for buying and selling of their properties.Buyers are one click away to get the information of all type of properties that are in and around them and sellers can register their properties by providing the specifications of their property.This makes real estate globalised.The traditional way of business takes more time but compare to real estate advisior time conflicts are decreased because the buyer and seller can access at any time.<br>

# Research

- Real estate is one of the major business which requires a high attention.while doing the research I found that mediators play a vital role in closing a deal.
Mediators take a huge amount of money on successful completion of a deal.To overcome this real estate advisor helps buyer to connect directly to the customer without any mediator. This decreases the burden to buyer and seller too.
- Time is also a barrier.In order to meet a person to view the property,the buyer's only source is mediator so it takes more time to view the property.

## Real-estste advisor has advantages ans a disadvantages too.

### Advantages

-There can be fraudsters who might keep fake information. So the two parties (Buyer and sellers ) need to be very particular in checking the proofs
