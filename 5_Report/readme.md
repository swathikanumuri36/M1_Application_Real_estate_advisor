# Research

- Real estate is one of the major business which requires a high attention.while doing the research I found that mediators play a vital role in closing a deal.
Mediators take a huge amount of money on successful completion of a deal.To overcome this real estate advisor helps buyer to connect directly to the customer without any mediator. This decreases the burden to buyer and seller too.
- Time is also a barrier.In order to meet a person to view the property,the buyer's only source is mediator so it takes more time to view the property.
